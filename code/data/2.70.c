/*
 * 2.70
 *
 * Write code for the function with the following prototype:
 *
 * Return 1 when x can be represented as an n-bit, 2's-complement number;
 * 0 otherwise
 * Assume 1 <= n <= w
 *
 * Code must follow the same integer coding rules:
 *
 * 1. Integers are represented in two's complement form
 * 2. Right shifts of signed data are performed arithmetically
 * 3. Data type int is "w" bits long. Can use sizeof(int) << 3 to compute w.
 * 4. Conditionals, loops, switch statements, function calls, and macro
 * invocations are forbidden,
 * 5. Division, modulus, and multiplication are forbidden.
 * 6. Relative comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=) are forbidden.
 *
