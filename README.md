I'm a young and dumb cyber guy. Someday I hope to be neither of those things.

I'm an aspiring network security professional, but I've always had this itch to better understand computing at a low-level. 

To me, that means getting good at C, and learning some assembly along the way.

This repo is my attempt at doing this.

I'm using a book to guide my learning. I've chosen "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 3rd Edition" (CS:APP). For years, it's been this old dusty artifact sitting on my bookshelf, taunting me, like the Green Goblin's mask. It knows I have almost no hope of understanding its teachings. But maybe, with the power of friendship, I can prove it wrong.
